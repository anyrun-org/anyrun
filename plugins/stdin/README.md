# Stdin

Reads lines from the standard input and fuzzy matches on those. The selected one is printed to stdout.
Allows for easy integration into scripts that have been made with something like dmenu in mind.

## Usage

This plugin should generally be used alone, if a dmenu replacement is needed. This can be done with `anyrun --plugins libstdin.so`.
The content to fuzzy match on needs to be piped into Anyrun.

## Configuration

```ron
Config(
  // Whether to allow the user to input any arbitrary text besides the options provided
  allow_invalid: false,
  // How many entries should be displayed at max
  max_entries: 5,
  // Whether to preserve the original order of entries instead of sorting by fuzzy match score. Matches are still filtered out if there is no similarity to input.
  preserve_order: false,
)

```
