# Input
A simple plugin to make anyrun act like an input field, or in other words, it will return what you typed.

## Note
It's important to have this plugin loaded last, because otherwise, it will take priority over other ones, which makes it the permanent first option.
It's probably most useful as the only plugin loaded anyway.
I also recommend using `--hide-plugin-info true`.
